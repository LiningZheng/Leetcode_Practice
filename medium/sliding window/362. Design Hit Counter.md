Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.

Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity) and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (ie, the timestamp is monotonically increasing). You may assume that the earliest timestamp starts at 1.

Follow up:
What if the number of hits per second could be very large? Does your design scale?

```java

class Solution {
public class HitCounter {
        
        static private windowLen = 300; // 300s
        // each int[] inside the LinkedList contains {timestamp, hitCount}
        private LinknedList<int[]> records;
        private int curHitSum = 0;    
        
            
        /** Initialize your data structure here. */
        public HitCounter() {
            records = new LinknedList<>();
        }

        /** Record a hit.
            @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
        
        public void hit(int timestamp) {
            int[] latestRecord = records.getLast();
            if (latestRecord[0] == timestamp)
                latestRecord[1] += 1;
            else records.add(new int[] {timestamp, 1});
            
            curHitSum += 1;
        }

        /** Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes.
            @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
        public int getHits(int timestamp) {
            int startTime = timestamp - windowLen;
            while (!records.isEmpty() && records.getFirst()[0] <= startTime) {
                int[] firstRecord = records.removeFirst();
                curHitSum -= firstRecord[1];
            }
            return curHitSum;
        }
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(windowLen). 
Time complexity: hit -> O(1), getHits -> O(windowLen)
