```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;
        int curArea = 0;
        
        while (low < high) {
            curArea = (high - low) * Math.min(height[low], height[high]);
            if (curArea > maxArea)
                maxArea = curArea;
            
            if (height[low] >= height[high]) high -= 1;
            else low += 1;
        }
        
        return maxArea;
    }
}
```

Two pointers on each end of the array, moving towards each other. The one with the lower height moves. If equal, either works.

It's much easier to prove the correctness by drawing on a whiteboard xD. I'm sure I'll be able to recall every detail in an actual interview as long as I keep in mind some important points:

1) Height and width are two factors contributing to the area. We start with the maximum width. We only compromise the width if we can gain increase in height.
In other words, if a shorter height appears on the right of low or left of high, we don't pick it. 

2) Based on 1), imagine the case for the max area. The integers before low must be smaller than height[low]. 
Likewise, the integers after high much be smaller than height[high]. This is the foundation to justify your solution :D

3) Don't overlook the corner case. Remember to prove the case where height[low] and height[high] are equal.
