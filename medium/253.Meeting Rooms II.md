Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), 

find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

###  1 PriorityQueue

Sort the intervals by the starting time. 

Use a priority queue for the intervals, ordered by the ending time.
PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<int[]>((a, b) -> (a[1] - b[1]));

Iterate the intervals, if the top interval of pq's ending time is before current interval's starting time, pq.poll();

Then pq.offer(curInterval).

In this way, pq.size() increases by 1 (when the top is popped) or stays unchanged for each time. 

Increasing by 1 happens only when there's a need for a new room. 

Thus pq.size() after the entire iteration is the result to return. 

Time: O(NlogN), due to the sorting.

Space: O(k), where k is the minum # of rooms required.


### 2 Simulation

```java
public int minMeetingRooms(int[][] intervals) {
    if (intervals.length <= 0) return 0; // in case of int[0][2] 
    
    int[] starts = int[intervals.length];
    int[] ends = int[intervals.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        starts[i] = intervals[i][0];
        ends[i] = intervals[i][1];
    }
    Arrays.sort(starts);
    Arrays.sort(ends);
    
    int maxRoomNum = 0;
    int curRoomNum = 0;
    int endTimeIndx = 0;
    for (int startTime : starts) {
        curRoomNum += 1;
        while (ends[endTimeIndx] <= startTime) {
            endTimeIndx += 1;
            curRoomNum -= 1;
        }
        maxRoomNum = Math.max(maxRoomNum, curRoomNum);
    }
    
    return maxRoomNum;
}
```
Simulate the situations at the starting time of each time interval, keeping track of number of minimum rooms required at each time point.

When an starting is encountered, it means a new room is created/required.

When an ending is encountered, it means a room is released.

Time: O(NLogN)
Space: O(N)
