Problem Description:

On a horizontal number line, we have gas stations at positions stations[0], stations[1], ..., stations[N-1], where N = stations.length.

Now, we add K more gas stations so that D, the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations, is minimized.

Return the smallest possible value of D.

Example:

Input: stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], K = 9
Output: 0.500000
Note:

1 stations.length will be an integer in range [10, 2000].

2 stations[i] will be an integer in range [0, 10^8].

3 K will be an integer in range [1, 10^6].

4 Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.

I haven't tested my solution with OJ because it's locked for subscribed users.

I think the trickiest part during the interview is actually how to prove the greedy canPut() method is logically valid.
