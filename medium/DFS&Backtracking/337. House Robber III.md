```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        int[] res = robSum(root);
        return Math.max(res[0], res[1]);
    }
    
    //int[0] is the sum when robbing the current root
    //int[1] is the sum when not robbing the current root
    private int[] robSum(TreeNode root) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        if (root == null) return res;
        
        int[] leftSum = robSum(root.left);
        int[] rightSum = robSum(root.right);
        
        res[0] = leftSum[1] + rightSum[1] + root.val;
        // you have a choice to rob or not rob the children, depending on which option results in more money
        res[1] = Math.max(leftSum[0], leftSum[1]) + Math.max(rightSum[0], rightSum[1]); 
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

This is actually DP. 

Initially, I thought of using two recursive functions to calculate the resulting money when robbing or not robbing the current node respectively.
However, that results in repeated subtasks. To improve the time complexity, I'll have to construct a seperate tree to store the middle results. xDD 

So it's complex.

Since the result of current node only relies on its children, we can use the solution presented in the code above.
