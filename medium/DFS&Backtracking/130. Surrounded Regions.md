```C++

public:
    void solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        if (board.size() <= 0) return;
        
        int n = board.size();
        int m = board[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            markUnflippable(board, i, 0);
            markUnflippable(board, i, m - 1);
        }
        
        for (int j = 1; j < m - 1; j++) {
            markUnflippable(board, 0, j);
            markUnflippable(board, n - 1, j);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'N') board[i][j] = 'O';
                else if (board[i][j] == 'O') board[i][j] = 'X';
            }
        }
    }
    
    void markUnflippable(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size()) return;
        if (board[i][j] != 'O') return;
        
        board[i][j] = 'N';
        markUnflippable(board, i + 1, j);
        markUnflippable(board, i - 1, j);
        markUnflippable(board, i, j + 1);
        markUnflippable(board, i, j - 1);
    }
};
```

Idea: those unflippable chunks of 'O's always touch the boundaries of the matrix. "markUnflippable" identifies 
those unflippable 'O's and make them as 'N'. After the marking of unflippable 'O's, do a final flipping: 
'O' - > 'X' because they are flippable; 'N' -> 'O' because they are not flippable.

We don't necessarily need an extra matrix to keep track of visited elements because the recursive function only continues 
when meeting 'O', and 'O's that have been visited are changed into 'N'. Besides, the capturable 'O' areas are never accessed by the recursive function.
