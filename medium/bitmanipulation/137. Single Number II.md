### 1

Use HashMap to count the occurrences.
O(N) space complexity

### 2 bit manipulation
O(1) space complexity

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int posOne = 0;
        int posTwo = 0;
        
        for (int i : nums) {
            posOne = (posOne ^ i) & (posTwo);
            posTwo = (posTwo ^ i) | (posOne);
        }
        return posTwo;
    }
}
```

Following his approach, I designed a slightly different counting loop with two bits: 00 -> 01 -> 11 -> 00, 
representing 0 to 2 then back to 0

A few important things to keep in mind when you design the rules for the counting loop:

1) when meeting 1, go to the next step of the determined counting loop.

2) when meeting 0, remain unchanged.

3) in the actual programming, there's an order of updating posOne and posTwo. in my case, posTwo actually uses the newly updated posOne.
