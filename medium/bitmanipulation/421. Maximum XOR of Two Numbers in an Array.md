### 1 brute force
O(N^2)

### 2 Hashset
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaximumXOR(int[] nums) {
        int maxRes = 0;
        int allOneMask = 0; // start with all ones. e.g., 100, 110, 111, if we ignore the leftmost bit
        
        for (int i = 30; i >= 0; i--) { // ignore the leftmost bit because all numbers are non-negative.
            int singleMask = 1 << i;
            int wanted = maxRes | singleMask; // what we would like to get ideally. e.g., previously maxRes = 1101. after this round we want 11011
            allOneMask |= singleMask;
            
            Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
            for (int num : nums) {
                set.add(num & allOneMask);
            }
            
            for (int cand : set) {
                int other = wanted ^ cand;
                if (set.contains(other)) {
                    maxRes = wanted;
                    break;
                }
            }
            // it's possibly we can't get what we want.
        }
        
        return maxRes;
    }
}
```

idea: checking each bit from most significant to least significant. The key is to reduce the complexity with a hashset.

### 3 Trie
build a trie using the input num array. the height will be 31. then for each number, find its best match by going down through the trie. among these best matches, find the max one.
