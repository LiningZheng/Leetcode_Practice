```SQL
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee 
WHERE Salary != 
(SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)

similarly:

SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
WHERE Salary <
(SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)

SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
WHERE Salary NOT IN
(SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
```

using ORDER BY and LIMIT.
The problem requires a NULL if the select result is empty...

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT Salary as SecondHighestSalary 
FROM Employee 
UNION (SELECT NULL)
ORDER BY SecondHighestSalary DESC LIMIT 1,1
```

NULL is considered the smallest value in ordering.
