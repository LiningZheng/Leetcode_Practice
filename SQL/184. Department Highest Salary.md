```SQL
SELECT d.Name Department, e.Name Employee, e.Salary Salary
FROM Employee e, 
(
    SELECT DepartmentId, MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary 
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY DepartmentId
) T,
Department d

WHERE e.DepartmentId = d.Id AND
e.DepartmentId = T.DepartmentId AND
e.Salary = T.MaxSalary
```

use a subquery to find the department highest salary.

FROM Employee e, Department d
WHERE e.DepartmentId = d.Id AND

    SELECT DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY DepartmentId
)
```
