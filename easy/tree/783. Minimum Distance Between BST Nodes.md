```C++
class Solution {
public:
    
    int minDiffInBST(TreeNode* root) {
        int min_dist = INT_MAX;
        TreeNode* prev = nullptr;
        inorder(root, min_dist, &prev);
        return min_dist;
    }
    
    // can also use int* min_dist as a paramter with changes made accordingly in the method
    void inorder(TreeNode* root, int& min_dist, TreeNode** prev) {
        if (root == nullptr) return;
        
        inorder(root->left, min_dist, prev);
        
        if (*prev) {
            min_dist = min(min_dist, root->val - (*prev)->val);
        }
        *prev = root;
        
        inorder(root->right, min_dist, prev);
    }
};
```

* in-order search, logically converting the tree into an ordered sequence.
* Similar approach in Java requires two global varialbes for min_dist and prev. However, C++'s pointer and reference 
enables the modification of the original variable in a function.
