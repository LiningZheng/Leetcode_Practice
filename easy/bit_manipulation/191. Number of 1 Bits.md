normal way
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int x = 32;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
            if ((n & 1) == 1) count++;
            n >>>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### 2
use n-1 and n to do things on the last 1 bit :)
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            n &= (n - 1); // to remove the last 1 bit
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
