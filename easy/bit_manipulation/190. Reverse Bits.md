```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 31; i++) {
            result |= n & 1;
            n >>>= 1;
            result <<= 1;
        }
        return result | (n & 1);
    }
}
```

1) difference between >>> and >>
2) figure out how many times to move. from pos 0 to pos 31, it's 31 times. not 32.
